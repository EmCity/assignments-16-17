#### 1. Why do we need cookies?
* We need cookies when we want to store state of an application client sided. E.g if we want to remember our login and not to type everything everytime, we save the state that we are logged in into the cookie.
#### 2. Why is it necessary to call session_start() before any output is generated by PHP?
* When we use session we will need to modify the HTTP Response Header. However, when any output is generated by PHP, then we can no longer modify the HTTP Response Header.
#### 3. Cookies are “serialized”. Explain this term.
* Cookies are basically some data structures, in order to transport them, e.g. in the server and client communication, these data structures are transformed into a certain format to be processed on the other end.
#### 4. What’s the name of a cookie that is deleted after the browser is closed?
* Transient aka in-memory aka session cookie
