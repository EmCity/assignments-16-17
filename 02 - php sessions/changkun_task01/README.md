## a) Why do we need cookies?

we need cookies for store temprory information for web applications.

## b) Why is it necessary to call `session_start()` before any output is generated by PHP?

Server is sending HTTP(S) headers and `\n\n` in the end, and then starting to send the webpage contents. But `session_start()` is sending "it's own" headers, thus we can't send any headers when they're already finished.

## c) Cookies are "serialized". Explain this term.

Serialization of cookies is a term that describes a process of translating cookies into HTTP(S) headers as a specific format, which can be stord.

## d) What's the name of a cookie that is deleted after the browser is closed?

Session cookie.
(In face it depends on modern browser settings I suppose...)
